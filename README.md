# Description
In this project I have made the Rock paper scissor game. I compiled it in Python IDLE. 

It is a very popular game based on simple rules. Rock beats scissor, scissor beats paper
and paper beats rock.
Inside the while loop I took the the choice from the user and then for or generating the choice of 
the the computer I used the random function. I took the choices in the form of integers for easy comparison.
I used the if statement for comparing the two choices. Depending upon the rules the winner is selected.
